|h1>On Histiaeus</h1>|
||<p>However, according to Herodotus, Histiaeus was unhappy having to stay in|
||Susa, and made plans to return to his position as King of Miletus by|
||instigating a revolt in Ionia. In 499 BC, he shaved the head of his|
||most trusted slave, tattooed a message on his head, and then waited for|
||his hair to grow back. The slave was then sent to Aristagoras, who was|
||instructed to shave the slave's head again and read the message, which|
||told him to revolt against the Persians.</p>|
